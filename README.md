Simple Command-Line Calculator in Java

A basic Java program that serves as a calculator operated through the command line. Users are prompted to input two numbers and then choose an arithmetic operator from the given list (+, -, *, /, %). The result is then computed and displayed.

Features:

Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
User-friendly interface with guided prompts for inputs.
Handles the potential error of division by zero with an appropriate error message.
Usage:
To use this calculator, compile the FirstClass.java file and then run the resulting bytecode. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform calculations.

You can further customize this to suit your needs, but this should give a good starting point for GitHub users to understand the purpose and functionality of your code.
